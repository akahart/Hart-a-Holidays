PLACEHOLDER: You'll need to create icon-192.png and icon-512.png
These should be 192x192 and 512x512 PNG images with a travel/beach theme.

Quick option: Use any online icon generator with the emoji ✈️ or 🏝️
Or create simple colored squares with the emojis in the center.

For now, the app will work without icons, but you'll want to add them before installing on iPhones.
